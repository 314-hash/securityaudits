# Blockchain Security Audit Toolkit

A comprehensive Python-based toolkit for conducting thorough blockchain and DeFi smart contract security audits.

## Features

- **Signature Analysis**: Advanced pattern matching for detecting high and medium risk function signatures in smart contracts
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk level determination and detailed security recommendations
- **DeFi Focus**: Specialized analysis for DeFi protocols and common attack vectors

## Installation

```bash
pip install web3 eth-utils eth-abi
git clone https://github.com/314-hash/securityaudits.github.io
cd securityaudits.github.io
```

## Quick Start

```python
from audit_tools.signature_analyzer import SignatureAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = SignatureAnalyzer()

# Analyze function signatures
results = analyzer.analyze_signatures([
    "transferOwnership(address)",
    "delegatecall(bytes)",
    "withdraw(uint256)"
])

# Print results
print(f"Overall Risk Level: {results['risk_level']}")
print("\nFindings:")
for finding in results['findings']:
    print(f"- {finding['signature']}: {finding['risk_level']} risk")
print("\nRecommendations:")
for rec in results['recommendations']:
    print(f"- {rec}")
```

## Components

### SignatureAnalyzer

The `SignatureAnalyzer` class provides functionality to analyze smart contract function signatures for potential security risks. It categorizes risks into three levels:

- **HIGH**: Critical security risks like `delegatecall`, `selfdestruct`, etc.
- **MEDIUM**: Potentially risky operations like transfers, administrative functions, etc.
- **LOW**: Standard functions with no immediate security concerns

### Risk Patterns

The analyzer checks for various risk patterns including:

#### High Risk Patterns
- delegatecall operations
- selfdestruct capability
- raw operations
- assembly code usage
- signature recovery (ecrecover)
- ownership transfers

#### Medium Risk Patterns
- transfer functions
- administrative operations
- token approvals
- asset management functions
- external calls
- minting/burning capabilities
